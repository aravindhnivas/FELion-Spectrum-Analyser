# FELion-Spectrum-Analyser

## INSTALL

Ananconda for python 3.7.x must be installed first (currently tested for python 3.7.2, maybe you can try it in latest version if present).

1.	First install git from 'GitForWindows' folder.
2.	Install the program using "install.bat" (Admin-access required; since it also installs the missing packages).
3.	FELion-GUI shorcut will be created in your desktop.
4.	The program is actually installed in C:\FELion-GUI\software.
