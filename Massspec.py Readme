Readme Massspec.py

Massspec.py is a program who designs graphs for your messured mass spectra.

The program has two uses. first of all, a quick and easy scan:

python3 Massspec.py (date)-(number) will give you the spectrum of that date and number for example:

python3 Massspec.py 25_05_18-3 will give that spectrum


The second part is too overlay some spectra. this can be done by:

python3 Massspec.py (date)-(number) -a (number for the amount of spectra)

for example

python3 Masspec.py 25_05_18-2 -a 3 

will ask you for 3 spectra which will be stacked on top of each other via a user prompt. If you want to stack graphs from the same day, only the serie number is enough in the user prompt. It also asks for a legenda and some physical parameters for in the title which can be skip just by pressing enter.
