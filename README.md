# FELion-Spectrum-Analyser

## INSTALL

Ananconda for python 3.7.x must be installed first (currently tested on python 3.7.2, maybe you can try it in latest version).

Make sure you copy this whole folder into your local disk and try the following steps.

1.	First install git from 'GitForWindows' folder.
2.	Install the program using "install.bat" (Admin-access required; since it also installs the missing packages).
3.	FELion-GUI shorcut will be created in your desktop.
4.	The program is actually installed in C:\FELion-GUI\software.
